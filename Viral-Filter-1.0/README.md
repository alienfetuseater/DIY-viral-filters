# Viral-Filter-1.0

This is the first prototype for the requested inline viral filter using fabric from a N95 mask.

The design failed testing. Too much leaking occurred between the two sections. 
I believe that a snap together design based only on the sealing of the N95 mask fabric is fundamentally inadequate.

This design is CONFIRMED UNSAFE.
