Attached are the second prototype for the viral filter. 
It utilizes an o-ring to attempt to provide better sealing. 
The N95 would be placed in first and then the O-ring second. 
This order of assembly is to protect the filter for rotational distortion when screwing the two halves together.

The o-ring utilized is available from Home Depot.
1-1/2in x 1-1/4 in x 1/8 in
